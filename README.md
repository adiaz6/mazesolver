The program uses a pathfinding algorithm (breadth-first search) to solve a maze.

The maze is shown on a Tkinter GUI window and can be provided in a text file using "#" and " " characters. The user can alternatively select the squares to mark the paths in the GUI window itself.
The user-generated mazes can be saved for use when the GUI is opened again.
